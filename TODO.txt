/*
1. Article component
2. Navigation component
3. Back button should take user to previous route
4. Builder pattern for components
5. Form functionality
  FormGroup: for something like an inner object like 'address'
  FormArray: for something like an inner array like 'tags' or 'orders'
6. Modals/Popups
7. Pre-built containers/forms/scenes for common use cases
8. More input types
9. A better set of examples. I want an app that has three routes: 'sign up form', 'about us article', and 'todo list'.
10. More mobile-friendliness, more responsive layouts
11. The 'theme' and the css code aren't very integrated yet.
